To do:
* ~~Beam weapon on middle mouse button, long range and OP~~.
* Bomb weapon on right mouse button, instantly kill everything.
* Death animations
* More color variations for enemies
* Huge enemy orb, need bomb or beam to kill
* ~~Big orbs spawn smaller orbs on death~~
* Background music, multilayered/random per background square
* Accelerating spawn timers (maybe not, spawning small from the big might be enough)
